## How to use ff command

`ff` command automatically download every 10 minutes.

* Add the path of `ffload` folder into your environment path. For instance, open .zshrc file with vi and add the following


* `vi ~/.zshrc`

```sh
export PATH="/Users/thruthesky/lab/ffloader:$PATH"
```

* Then, run `ff [key] [project-id]` and it will load and reload the Simulator.

* Open the project in VSCode

* Initialize the project folder with git
  * `git init`
  * `git branch -M main`
  * `git add .`
  * `git commit -a -m "first import"`


* Then, create a branch `work` and continue work.

* Create the launch.json in `work` branch or it will be deleted.

* Whenever there is update from FlutterFlow,
  * `git merge main`


## How to download code

- Run the `ffloader.sh` like below.

```sh 
ffloader.sh [key-file] [project-id]
```

- `key-file` is the file that has the FlutterFlow API Key.
- `project-id` is the FlutterFlow project id.


- example

```sh
./ffloader.sh ../keys/fireflow-api-key phi-lov-w6liu7
./ffloader.sh ../keys/fireflow-api-key hype-talk-tog63b
```

The `key-file.txt` is the file that has the FlutterFlow API key like below.

```txt
6afj808aa8-3141-a432-dsaf324114223
```


## How to run simulator

- Run in iOS Simulator. The device id is `8E7C4276-1F64-453C-AE32-422C59170B93`.

```sh
cd ./apps/xxx/xxx
flutter run -d 8E7C4276-1F64-453C-AE32-422C59170B93 --pid-file=../../../flutter.pid
```

- Run in Chrome browser.

```sh
cd ./apps/xxx/xxx
flutter run -d chrome --pid-file=../../../flutter.pid
```

- Run on iPhone11MaxPro (real device)

```sh
flutter run -d 00008030-000904C80290802E --pid-file=../../../flutter.pid
```


## Use multikey and auto re-download

```sh
./multi.sh free-expression-k5451h
```


## Debug in VSCode

Yes, you can do the same development as you do in Flutter with VSCode. Attach the VSCode to the running debug process and that's it.

- Open `launcher.json` and add someting like below.

```json
{
    "name": "FireFlow3 attach",
    "cwd": "apps/fire-flow3-pau336/fire_flow3",
    "request": "attach",
    "type": "dart",
    "program": "lib/main.dart",
    "deviceId": "8E7C4276-1F64-453C-AE32-422C59170B93",
    "args": ["--app-id", "com.withcenter.fireflow3"]
},
```

The request is `attach`.
And see the args with `--app-id`. You should input the bundle id(package name).
